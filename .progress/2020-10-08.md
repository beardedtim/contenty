## Thoughts

- It was not fun realizing that the thing I wanted to do was basically
impossible with my current understanding.
- I am happy that I was able to get as far as I did.
- Making abstractions is the _most_ fun part of this!
  - It's fun seeing how things are similar/different and then creating new
  _shortcuts_ with my computer to get them done.
- I _really_ want to work on this but have no idea where to start
  - Ask Dad?
