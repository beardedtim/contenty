## Thoughts

- Getting back into this was _WAY_ easier with the Todos/Outline done
  - I knew where to start and how to make an impact without fucking around
- It was fun and challenging to create ways for the consumer to query the API. If I was
doing this in a company with many people, I would look for some standard so I could lean
on tooling.
  - However, since this is for me, I'm not too worried
- Everything being abstract makes for fun ways to solve problems!
- If you use `Ramda.reduce` and _mutate_ the value, it CACHES IT!
