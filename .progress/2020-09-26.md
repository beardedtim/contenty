## Thoughts

- I like the concept of keeping track inside of the repo itself
- I like the concept of fleshing out the goals of the project as I go instead
of all at once.
  - This I think will help build the items that I actually need only when I need them
- I like the conecpt of keeping a running check list of what is in and what is not
  - This will become hard. I must stay serious about it or it'll be all for not
- I need to add some docs, somewhere, as I build the system. 
  - I SHOULD USE THE SYSTEM TO BUILD THE SYSTEM!!!!
  - If this is truly a CMS, it should be able to handle documentation!
